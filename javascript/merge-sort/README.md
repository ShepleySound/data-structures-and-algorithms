# Merge Sort

## What is a merge sort?

In a merge sort, we split the container in half until weâ€™ve broken it down into its smallest possible unit. In this case, our container is an array, and the smallest possible unit is an array with a single element.

Afterwards, we begin the sequence of merging. We use conditionals to check the size of the elements in each side, and build the array back up in a sorted manner, piece by piece.

It looks a bit like this:

Let's look a bit closer at how we break these down using pseudocode.

```
FUNCTION mergeSort(arr)
  DECLARE n <-- arr.length

  if n > 1
    DECLARE mid <-- n/2
    DECLARE left <-- arr[0...mid]
    DECLARE right <-- arr[mid...n]
    // sort the left side
    mergeSort(left)
    // sort the right side
    mergeSort(right)
    // merge the sorted left and right sides together
    merge(left, right, arr)
```

We're using recursion to continuously split the array in half. Technically, in this case, the *entire* left side of the array is split recursively, worked over, and sorted. *Then* we do the same for the right side. Only after both of these things happen do we merge both halves back into each other. Let's take a closer look at that final merge.

First, some pseudocode.

```
FUNCTION merge(left, right, arr)
  DECLARE i <-- 0
  DECLARE j <-- 0
  DECLARE k <-- 0

  while i < left.length && j < right.length
    if left[i] <= right[j]
      arr[k] <-- left[i]
      i <-- i + 1
    else
      arr[k] <-- right[j]
      j <-- j + 1

    k <-- k + 1

  *** Set the remaining values of arr to what is remaining in left, if anything ***
  while i < left.length
    arr[k] <-- left[i]
    i <-- i + 1
    k <-- k + 1

  *** Set the remaining values of arr to what is remaining in right, if anything ***
  while j < right.length
    arr[k] <-- right[j]
    j <-- j + 1
    k <-- k + 1
```

There's a lot going on here. Hopefully a visual will help to break down what's happening.
