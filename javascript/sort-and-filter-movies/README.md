# Sorting and Comparators

This challenge involves creating comparators that can act as functions in a JavaScript `sort` function. The functions compare values or properties of objects and return an integer based on the comparison. We can feed this function into JavaScript's `sort` function, and it will do the heavy lifting of looping through the array and sorting based on the comparator for us!

The comparators have been tested, as have the custom functions created by feeding the comparators into the `sort` method.
